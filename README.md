# VibeCheck - Aesthetic Social Media Companion

An innovative social media platform designed around aesthetic curation and cultural discovery. VibeCheck enables users to curate, share, and connect with others who share similar aesthetic preferences across cinema, music, gaming, literature, and travel.

## Overview

VibeCheck transforms how people express their tastes and discover kindred spirits. Rather than following traditional social hierarchies, users build an "Aura" — a unique aesthetic fingerprint based on their curated interests. The platform combines personalized content curation, social discovery, gamification, and community spaces to create a vibrant, taste-driven social experience.

## Key Features

### 🎨 Multi-Category Content Curation
Curate and preview your favorite content across five distinct categories, powered by real external APIs:
- **Cinema & TV**: Explore and share movies and television shows with detailed metadata, directors, and release information — sourced from real film/TV databases
- **Music**: Discover and curate albums with artist information and duration details — pulled from live music APIs
- **Games**: Browse video games across different platforms with difficulty ratings — fetched from gaming data services
- **Books**: Build your literary collection with comprehensive book data including page counts — integrated with book catalog APIs
- **Travel**: Create destination wishlists with real-time weather, timezone, and location information — driven by live travel and weather APIs

All content data is fetched from real third-party APIs, ensuring up-to-date and accurate information across every category.

**Smart Search**: Quickly find content across each category with real-time search filtering by title, artist, director, author, or other relevant metadata.

**Interactive Previews**: Each content item includes detailed preview cards with rich metadata, visual imagery, and sharing capabilities.

### 👤 Aesthetic Aura Profile System
Create your unique aesthetic identity that evolves with your curation:

- **Aesthetic Tags**: Semantic tags that capture your style (e.g., "cyberpunk," "minimalist," "vintage," "atmospheric")
